// ARRAYS are a kind of object!

// For..in -> objects
// For..of -> arrays

//primitive types are 'wrapped' as objects to have access to methods
//the object is later discarded -> highly optmized so the call isn't
//super expensive

//pop/push are cheap. shift/unshift are expensive

//u can treat arrays as objs (ex: arr.isCool = true;), but this will
//lead to bugs
